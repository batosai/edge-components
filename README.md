The components not shown here represent no gain over their HTML representation.

If your component becomes too complex, it may make more sense to use HTML directly as described in the daisyUI documentation.


## Setup

The first step is to install the package from the npm registry.

```sh
node ace add @jrmc/edge-components@next
```
